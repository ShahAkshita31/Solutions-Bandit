ssh bandit16@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 

In this level, your goal is to find a TLS/SSL-enabled service running on the server, retrieve a private SSH key, and then use that key to log in to the next level.

Step 1: Scan the Port Range for SSL Services
Use nmap to scan all ports from 31000 to 32000 on localhost and detect service versions:
--> nmap -sV localhost -p 31000-32000
Command explaination:
-sV: Enables version detection (helps identify SSL/TLS services).
-p 31000-32000: Limits the scan to the specified port range.

What to Look For:
In the output, look for ports labeled with services like:
ssl/unknown
ssl/echo
ssl/echo is often a misconfigured or irrelevant service. The correct one is usually ssl/unknown.

Step 2: Connect to the SSL Port to Retrieve the Private Key
Use the current level's password to connect and retrieve the private SSH key. You can try:
--> openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790
But if you run into a KEYUPDATE issue or see no response, you can use:
--> echo "password_of_next_level" | openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790
echo sends the password to the SSL service.

openssl s_client establishes the TLS connection.
This should return a private SSH key in the output.

Step 3: Save the Private Key in a Secure File
You won’t have write permission in your current directory, so work in /tmp.
--> mkdir /tmp/bandit16_sshkey
--> cd /tmp/bandit16_sshkey
--> touch private.sshkey
--> nano private.sshkey    # Paste the private key into this file
Tip: After pasting, save and exit nano with Ctrl + O, then Enter, and Ctrl + X.

To confirm the key was saved:
--> cat private.sshkey

Step 4: Fix the File Permissions
SSH private keys must be readable only by you, or SSH will refuse to use them.

--> chmod 600 private.sshkey
This sets the permission to: Read and write only by the owner (you).

Step 5: Use the Key to Log In to the Next Level
Now you can log in to bandit16 using the key:
--> ssh -i private.sshkey bandit16@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

If successful, you’ll be logged into bandit16.
