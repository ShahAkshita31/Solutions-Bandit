and the password which we found in level 2

In Linux, the shell treats each word (separated by spaces) as a separate argument or command. 
So, when a filename contains spaces, you need to tell the shell that those spaces are part of the same filename.

Using backslashes (\) before each space
--> cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
Each backslash tells the shell that the space following it is part of the filename, not a separator.

                                -----------OR------------

Using quotation marks
--> cat "spaces in this filename"
Quotation marks tell the shell to treat everything inside as a single argument, including any spaces.
