In this level, the password is stored in the only line that appears once in the file data.txt.

sort data.txt | uniq -u
Why This Command?
At first, it might seem like just using uniq -u would be enough to find the unique line. However, there's an important detail:
uniq -u does not check the entire file for uniqueness.
It only compares adjacent lines.
That means if the same line appears multiple times but not next to each other, uniq -u will not detect it unless the file is sorted first.

Explanation of Each Part:
sort data.txt→ Sorts all the lines in the file so that identical lines are grouped together.
| → Pipes the output of the sort command to the next command.
uniq -u → Filters the input to show only lines that occur exactly once.
The output will be a single unique line — this line contains the password for the next level.

Copy that line and use it to log into the next level.
