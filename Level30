ssh bandit29@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220  

After cloning the repository, the default branch (master or main) contains a README.md file. But when you read it, it says:
Not available in production
This message suggests that the password might not be in the production environment, but instead hidden in another branch, such as a development branch.

1. List All Available Branches
To view both local and remote-tracking branches:
git branch -a
You might see something like:
* main
  remotes/origin/dev
  remotes/origin/main
This means there is a remote dev branch that we haven’t checked out yet.

2. Switch to the dev Branch
To view the contents of the development branch:
git checkout dev
This switches your working directory to reflect the contents of the dev branch.

3. Check the Files in dev Branch
Run:
ls
You’ll likely see a familiar file, such as: README.md
Now open it: cat README.md
And there it is — the password for bandit29!
