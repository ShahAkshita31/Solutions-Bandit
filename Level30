After cloning the repository, the default branch (master or main) contains a README.md file. But when you read it, it says:

arduino
Copy
Edit
Not available in production
This message suggests that the password might not be in the production environment, but instead hidden in another branch, such as a development branch.

ðŸ§­ Step-by-Step Instructions
âœ… 1. List All Available Branches
To view both local and remote-tracking branches:

bash
Copy
Edit
git branch -a
You might see something like:

bash
Copy
Edit
* main
  remotes/origin/dev
  remotes/origin/main
This means there is a remote dev branch that we havenâ€™t checked out yet.

ðŸ”„ 2. Switch to the dev Branch
To view the contents of the development branch:

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout dev
This switches your working directory to reflect the contents of the dev branch.

ðŸ“‚ 3. Check the Files in dev Branch
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
ls
Youâ€™ll likely see a familiar file, such as:

Copy
Edit
README.md
Now open it:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat README.md
And there it is â€” the password for bandit29!
