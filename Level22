In this level, the password for the next level is being generated and stored automatically by a cron job.

What is a Cron Job?
A cron job is a time-based task scheduler in Unix/Linux.
It runs commands or scripts automatically at scheduled intervals — like a built-in task timer.
The schedule is controlled using 5 asterisks (* * * * *), which means: Run every minute, every hour, every day, every month, and every day of the week.

Step 1: Check the Cron Jobs
Cron jobs are listed in:
--> cd /etc/cron.d
List the files there:
--> ls -la /etc/cron.d
You’ll find several files, including one named:
cronjob_bandit22

Step 2: Inspect the Cron Job File
Use cat to read the cron job: cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit22
You’ll see something like:
* * * * * bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh
This means: Every minute, as user bandit22, the system runs: /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh

Step 3: See What the Script Does
cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh
-->It might look like this:
    #!/bin/bash
    cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 > /tmp/secret_bandit22
    This line copies the password from the real password file and writes it to: /tmp/secret_bandit22

Step 4: Read the Password
Now that you know where the password is stored and that it’s publicly readable (due to 644 permissions), run: cat /tmp/secret_bandit22

This will show you the password for bandit22.
