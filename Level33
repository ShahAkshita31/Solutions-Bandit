In this level, the instructions in the README.md file guide you to create a file named key.txt with specific content. This file needs to be committed and pushed to the remote repository to receive the password for the next level.

🧭 Step-by-Step Instructions
✅ 1. Create the key.txt File
Use the echo command to create the file with the required content:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo "May I come in?" > key.txt
📥 2. Stage the File for Commit
The repository may have a .gitignore that excludes key.txt, so you’ll need to force-add it:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add -f key.txt
-f stands for force — it overrides .gitignore rules and stages the file anyway.

✅ 3. Commit the File
Now, create a commit with a meaningful message:

bash
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "Adding key.txt to request access"
⬆️ 4. Push to the Remote master Branch
Push your changes to the remote repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin master
🎉 What Happens Next?
Once the key.txt file is pushed, the server-side Git hook detects it, processes your message, and returns the password for the next level in the terminal output.
