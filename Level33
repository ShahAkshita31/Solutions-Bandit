In this level, the instructions in the README.md file guide you to create a file named key.txt with specific content. 
This file needs to be committed and pushed to the remote repository to receive the password for the next level.

Step 1. Create the key.txt File
Use the echo command to create the file with the required content: echo "May I come in?" > key.txt

Step 2. Stage the File for Commit
The repository may have a .gitignore that excludes key.txt, so youâ€™ll need to force-add it: git add -f key.txt
-f stands for force, it overrides .gitignore rules and stages the file anyway.

Step 3. Commit the File
Now, create a commit with a meaningful message: git commit -m "Adding key.txt to request access"

Step 4. Push to the Remote master Branch
Push your changes to the remote repository: git push origin master

Once the key.txt file is pushed, the server-side Git hook detects it, processes your message, and returns the password for the next level in the terminal output.
