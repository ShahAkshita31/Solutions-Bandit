ssh bandit33@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 

When you log in as bandit33, you’ll notice something unusual, everything you type is automatically converted to uppercase.

For example:
ls
is interpreted as: LS

This is a restricted environment where the shell has been configured to transform input to uppercase,
effectively breaking most Linux commands (since they are case-sensitive).

How to Escape the Uppercase Shell
To break out of this uppercase-wrapping behavior, you can run: $0

Why $0 Works:
$0 in shell scripting represents the name of the shell you're running.
When you type $0, it executes a new shell (like spawning a subshell).
The new shell does not inherit the uppercase constraint, so you regain normal control.
Once you're in the subshell, you can verify it’s working correctly: whoami
# Output: bandit33

Get the Password for the Next Level
Now that your shell is working normally again, retrieve the next level’s password: cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33

You’ve now bypassed the uppercase filter and accessed the password for bandit34.
