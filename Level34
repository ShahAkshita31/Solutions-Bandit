ssh bandit33@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 
When you log in as bandit33, you’ll notice something unusual — everything you type is automatically converted to uppercase.

For example:

bash
Copy
Edit
ls
is interpreted as:

nginx
Copy
Edit
LS
This is a restricted environment where the shell has been configured to transform input to uppercase, effectively breaking most Linux commands (since they are case-sensitive).

🧠 How to Escape the Uppercase Shell
To break out of this uppercase-wrapping behavior, you can run:

bash
Copy
Edit
$0
🔍 Why $0 Works:
$0 in shell scripting represents the name of the shell you're running.

When you type $0, it executes a new shell (like spawning a subshell).

The new shell does not inherit the uppercase constraint, so you regain normal control.

Once you're in the subshell, you can verify it’s working correctly:

bash
Copy
Edit
whoami
# Output: bandit33
🔐 Get the Password for the Next Level
Now that your shell is working normally again, retrieve the next level’s password:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33
🎉 Done! You’ve now bypassed the uppercase filter and accessed the password for bandit34.
