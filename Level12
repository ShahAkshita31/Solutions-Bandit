In this level, the password is stored in a file called data.txt and is encoded using ROT13 encryption.
What is ROT13?
ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher.
It replaces each letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet.
Since the alphabet has 26 letters, applying ROT13 twice brings you back to the original text.

For example:
A → N
N → A
B → O
Z → M

Command to Use:
--> cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'

Explanation of the Command:
cat data.txt → Displays the contents of the file.
| → Pipes the output from cat into the next command.
tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' → Uses the tr (translate) command to substitute letters:
'A-Za-z' → all uppercase and lowercase letters.
'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' → how those letters should be rotated (13 characters forward).
This effectively decodes the ROT13 text and reveals the password.

The output of the command will be the decoded password for the next level.
