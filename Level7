ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 
In this level, the password is stored in a file somewhere on the entire server, and the file must meet specific conditions:

It is owned by user bandit7

It belongs to group bandit6

It is exactly 33 bytes in size

Command to Use:
find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null

Explanation of the Command:
find / → Start searching from the root directory (/), meaning search the entire file system.

-type f → Look for files only.
-user bandit7 → The file must be owned by user bandit7.
-group bandit6 → The file must belong to group bandit6.
-size 33c → File size must be exactly 33 bytes (c stands for bytes).
2>/dev/null → This part redirects error messages (like "Permission denied") to /dev/null, effectively hiding them from your output so you can see only valid results.

--> cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
This will display the password for the next level.
