ssh bandit28@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 

After cloning the Git repository into a writable directory (like /tmp), you’ll notice that the file (e.g., README.md) is present, 
but the password is not directly visible in the current version.

This is where Git’s version control features become powerful you can inspect the commit history to see what has changed over time, 
including any lines that were added or removed.

Step 1. Clone the Repo:
mkdir /tmp/bandit28
cd /tmp/bandit28
git clone ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo
cd repo

Step 2. View Commit History with Changes:
To get a detailed look at what was changed, including added/removed lines:
git log -p README.md
This shows: The author of each commit, date/time and the diff — i.e., the changes made to the file at each commit

Alternatively, you can just use: git show
This shows the latest commit with full diff output.

Understanding Git Diff Output:
Lines starting with - → Removed lines from the file
Lines starting with + → Added lines to the file
If you see - password: XXXXXX → This line was removed, meaning it existed in a previous commit
A -+ pattern doesn't exist, but you may be referring to a sequence where a line was removed and then another line was added
So, if the password was deleted in a later commit, it can still be seen in the commit history.

3. Get the Password:
Once you spot the removed line that says something like:
- password: password_for_next_level
That’s the password for bandit28.

Copy it and use it to SSH into the next level.
