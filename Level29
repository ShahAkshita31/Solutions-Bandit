ssh bandit28@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 

After cloning the Git repository into a writable directory (like /tmp), you’ll notice that the file (e.g., README.md) is present, 
but the password is not directly visible in the current version.

This is where Git’s version control features become powerful — you can inspect the commit history to see what has changed over time, 
including any lines that were added or removed.

Step 1. Clone the Repo (if not already done):
mkdir /tmp/bandit28
cd /tmp/bandit28
git clone ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo
cd repo
📖 2. View Commit History with Changes:
To get a detailed look at what was changed, including added/removed lines:

bash
Copy
Edit
git log -p README.md
This shows:

The author of each commit

The date/time

The diff — i.e., the changes made to the file at each commit

Alternatively, you can just use:

bash
Copy
Edit
git show
This shows the latest commit with full diff output.

🧠 Understanding Git Diff Output:
Lines starting with - → Removed lines from the file

Lines starting with + → Added lines to the file

If you see - password: XXXXXX → This line was removed, meaning it existed in a previous commit

A -+ pattern doesn't exist, but you may be referring to a sequence where a line was removed and then another line was added

So, if the password was deleted in a later commit, it can still be seen in the commit history.

🔐 3. Get the Password:
Once you spot the removed line that says something like:

diff
Copy
Edit
- password: xWZPtnzHfyTwmEy3rZgG
That’s the password for bandit28.

Copy it and use it to SSH into the next level.
