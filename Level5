In this level, the goal is to find a file that is human-readable—specifically, an ASCII text file.
All the files are stored inside the inhere directory, and only one of them is a readable text file.

To find the readable file, use one of the following commands:

find . -type f -exec file {} \; | grep "ASCII"
      -------------OR--------------
find . -type f -exec file {} + | grep "ASCII"

Explanation of the Command:
find . → Start searching from the current directory (. means “here”).
-type f → Look for files only (ignore directories).
-exec file {} \; → For each file found, run the file command to inspect its contents and determine the file type.
{} is a placeholder for the current file.
\; ends the -exec clause.
-exec file {} + → A more efficient version of -exec, which runs file on multiple files at once.
| grep "ASCII" → Filter the output to show only ASCII text files, which are human-readable.
./-file07: ASCII text
That means -file07 is the only human-readable file.


To print the password stored in the file:
cat ./-file07
