In this level, the password is buried inside a file that has been hexdumped and then compressed multiple times using various formats. 
We'll tackle this in three main steps:

Step 1: Creating a Working Directory
To avoid cluttering your home directory, we’ll do all the work in a temporary directory.
Navigate to the /tmp folder:
--> cd /tmp
Create a new temporary directory (named tmpdir):
-->mkdir tmpdir
         --------OR--------
--> mktemp -d
(This creates a uniquely named temporary directory.)

Enter the new directory:
--> cd tmpdir

Copy the data.txt file from the home directory to current directory ~/ specifies from home directory . specifies current directory:
--> cp ~/data.txt .

Rename the copied file:
--> mv data.txt data_hexdump
This helps identify that it’s a hexdump file.

Step 2: Reversing the Hexdump
The file is a hexdump and needs to be reversed to get back the original binary content.

Reverse the hexdump using xxd:
--> xxd -r data_hexdump comp_data
xxd is a tool to create or reverse a hexdump.
-r means reverse the hexdump.
data_hexdump is the input file.
comp_data is the output binary file that we'll now begin decompressing.

Step 3: Decompressing the File (Multiple Layers)
Now that you’ve reconstructed the binary file, it turns out it's been compressed multiple times using different methods. We'll identify each format and decompress step-by-step.

Repeated Process:
Each time, run file to identify the compression type, rename the file with the appropriate extension, and decompress.
Check the file type:
file comp_data

Let’s say the result is:gunzip
comp_data: gzip compressed data
Rename the file with the correct extension and decompress: gz is the extension
mv comp_data step1.gz
gunzip step1.gz

Repeat the process:
file step1          # Shows: bzip2 compressed data
mv step1 step2.bz2
bunzip2 step2.bz2
And so on...
You may encounter:

gzip → use gunzip
bzip2 → use bunzip2
tar → use tar -xf
POSIX tar archive again → tar -xf

Repeat this cycle until the final file reveals the password.
(Dont panic you are following the correct path, you have to decompress file for 8-9 times and then you'll reach to password)

This will reveal the password for the next level.
