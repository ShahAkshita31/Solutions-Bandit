Login using this command and enter the password which you found in readme file

The password for the next level is stored in a file named - (a single dash) in home directory

In Linux, the dash (-) is usually interpreted as a flag or option, not as a filename. So trying to read this file with a normal cat command like:
--> cat -
...would not work as expected, it would treat - as a special input source (stdin) instead of a filename.

Redirect input from the file using <
--> cat < -
This tells the shell to read input from a file literally named -

               ---------------OR--------------

Use a relative path
--> cat ./-
Here, ./ refers to the current directory, so this clearly tells cat that you're trying to read a file called - in the current folder.
