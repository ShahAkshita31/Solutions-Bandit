Login using command: ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 

In this level, when you try to log in to bandit18 using SSH, you are immediately logged out. 
This happens because the .bashrc file in the user's home directory has been modified in a way that causes the shell to exit as soon as it starts.

What’s Going On?
.bashrc is a hidden file that runs every time a new interactive shell is opened.
It's used to customize the shell (e.g., aliases, environment variables).
But in this case, someone added an exit command to .bashrc, so as soon as the shell opens, it exits immediately — preventing you from doing anything.

Solution: Bypass the Shell Using SSH Command Execution
Instead of logging in interactively, you can tell ssh to run a single command remotely. This way, .bashrc won’t be executed at all.

--> ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "cat readme"
Explanation:
ssh bandit18@... → You are logging into Bandit level 18.
-p 2220 → Specifies the custom port used by the Bandit server.
"cat readme" → The command to run immediately after connecting.

Since you are not opening a full shell, .bashrc is never sourced.
This avoids the immediate logout problem.

What is .bashrc and Why It Matters
.bashrc is a configuration script that runs when an interactive, non-login shell is opened.

It’s commonly used to: Set prompt styles, Define environment variables and Create shell aliases or shortcuts
If .bashrc is misconfigured or includes exit, it can automatically terminate your session, which is exactly what happens in this level.

Running the ssh command above will print the contents of the readme file directly and that file contains the password for bandit19.
