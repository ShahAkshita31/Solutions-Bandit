In this level, the goal is not just to find the password, but to also send it to a specific port on localhost (your own machine) to receive the next password.

Step 1: Retrieve the Password for This Level
Use the following command to read the current level's password:
--> cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14

Step 2: Send the Password to Port 30000 on localhost
Now that you have the password, use nc (Netcat) to send it:
--> nc localhost 30000
After running the command, paste the password and press Enter.

Explanation of the Command:
nc: Stands for Netcat, a tool used to read/write data over TCP or UDP connections.
localhost: Refers to your own machine.
30000: The port number the server is listening on.
Netcat allows your system to "talk" to another service (in this case, a service running on port 30000) by sending or receiving raw text data.

Once you send the password, the service running on port 30000 will respond with the password for the next level.
