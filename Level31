What Are Git Tags?
Git tags are used to mark specific commits as important or noteworthy, such as release points, stable versions, or in this case a secret.

Step 1. List All Tags
Use the following command to list all available Git tags: git tag
This will show you tags that may point to important commits.

Step 2. Inspect the Tag
Let’s say one of the tags is called secret. To see what it contains, use: git show secret
This will display: The commit the tag points to, Who created it and when, the diff or contents related to that commit
If password is hidden inside that commit message or file, git show will reveal it.
