When you log in and read the README.md file using:

bash

🏷️ What Are Git Tags?
Git tags are used to mark specific commits as important or noteworthy, such as release points, stable versions, or in this case — a secret.

🧭 Step-by-Step Instructions
✅ 1. List All Tags
Use the following command to list all available Git tags:

bash
Copy
Edit
git tag
This will show you tags that may point to important commits (e.g., secret, v1.0, etc.).

🔍 2. Inspect the Tag
Let’s say one of the tags is called secret. To see what it contains, use:

bash
Copy
Edit
git show secret
This will display:

The commit the tag points to

Who created it and when

The diff or contents related to that commit

💡 If the password is hidden inside that commit message or file, git show will reveal it.
