ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 

In this level, the password is stored in a file that meets specific conditions:
It is exactly 1033 bytes in size.
It is not executable.
It is a human-readable ASCII text file.

-->cd inhere 

You can use either of the following find commands:
find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable -exec file {} + | grep "ASCII"
                  ------------OR-------------
find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable -exec file {} \; | grep "text"
Command Breakdown
find . → Start searching from the current directory (.).
-type f → Look for files only.
-size 1033c → Match files that are exactly 1033 bytes (the c stands for bytes, or characters).
! -executable → Find files that are not executable (i.e., cannot be run like a program or script).
-exec file {} \; or -exec file {} + → Run the file command on each (or all) matching files to detect their type.
{} is a placeholder for each file.
\; ends the -exec clause (one file at a time).
+ runs file on multiple files at once (faster).
| grep "ASCII" or | grep "text" → Show only the results that contain "ASCII" or "text" (indicating human-readable content).

Once you identify the file, use:
cat ./inhere/maybehere07/.file2

This will display the password for the next level.
