In this level, the password for the next level is stored inside a hidden file located within the inhere directory.
In Linux or Unix systems, any file or directory that begins with a dot (.) is considered hidden and wonâ€™t show up with a normal ls command.

List all entries, including hidden ones:

ls -a
-a means list all files, including . (current directory) and .. (parent directory).
------------OR-----------
ls -A
-A is similar but excludes . and .., which can make things easier to read. Will work here because file has ... before the name

--> cat .  ..  ...Hiding-From-You
