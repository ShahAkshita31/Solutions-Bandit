In this level, the password is hidden inside the file data.txt, among a few human-readable strings, and is preceded by several = characters.

strings data.txt | grep =
Explanation of the Command:
strings data.txt→ Extracts and displays only printable ASCII text from the file.
This is useful for analyzing binary files, as it helps uncover hidden readable data.

| → Pipes the output of the strings command to the next command.
grep = → Filters and shows only the lines that contain an = character, since we’re told the password is preceded by several of them.

Look through the output for a line that contains a series of = characters followed by some readable text — that text is the password for the next level.
