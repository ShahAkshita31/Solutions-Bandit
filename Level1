--> ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -l bandit0

ssh: Secure Shell, a program used to log in to remote servers securely.
bandit.labs.overthewire.org: The hostname (remote server address) you're connecting to.
-p 2220: Specifies the port number (default SSH is 22, but Bandit uses port 2220).
-l bandit0: Tells SSH to log in as the user bandit0.
This command connects you to the Bandit server as the bandit0 user using SSH on port 2220.

Enter the password bandit0 and then you'll be logged in as bandit0

Once you're logged in as bandit0, the password for bandit1 is stored in a file named readme.
--> cat readme
cat: Short for concatenate, but commonly used to display the contents of a file.
readme: The name of the file that contains the password.
This command will print the password for the next level (bandit1) on the screen.

Save the password as you'll need it when logging in as bandit1
(It's a good practice to save all the passwords in a Word file for reference or in case you want to re-enter a level.)
