In this level, your goal is to create a small listening service (daemon) that sends the password to anyone who connects to it. 
Another binary on the system will connect to this listener automatically, expecting the password.

echo "password_for_this_level" | nc -l -p 1234 & 4444

Explanation of Each Part:
echo "password_for_this_level" → Prints the password for the current level.
| → Pipes that password into the next command (nc).
nc -l -p 1234 → Uses Netcat to:
-l → Listen for incoming connections.
-p 1234 → Listen on port 1234.
& → Runs the entire command in the background.
This means:
Your terminal is free to run other commands.
The Netcat listener keeps running silently.

What Is a Network Daemon?
A network daemon is a background program that Listens for incoming connections and Responds to specific requests
In this case, Netcat (nc) acts as a simple network daemon — quietly sitting and waiting for a connection, and when something connects, it sends the password.
Think of it like a silent server that will deliver a message once and then shut down.

Now that the listener is running in the background, run the provided binary (probably named suconnect or connect) like this:
./suconnect 1234
This binary connects to port 1234 on localhost.

It receives the password from your Netcat listener.
