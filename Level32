In this level, youâ€™re working with a Git repository where the goal is to:

Create a new file in the repository, Stage and commit that file locally, Push the commit to the remote master branch.
Once the changes are pushed, a server-side hook or automation on the remote end processes your commit and reveals the password.

Step 1. Navigate to the Cloned Repository
cd /tmp/<your_cloned_repo>  # Replace with your actual path

Step 2. Create a New File
You can create any file (e.g., report.txt):
echo "This is a test commit" > report.txt

Step 3. Stage the File
Use git add to stage the file for commit: git add report.txt

Step 4. Commit the File
Now commit your staged change with a message: git commit -m "Adding a test report file"

Step 5. Push to Remote master Branch
Push your changes using: git push origin master

Once the push is successful, the server will automatically process your commit and return the password to your terminal output.
