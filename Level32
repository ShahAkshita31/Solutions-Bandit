In this level, you’re working with a Git repository where the goal is to:

Create a new file in the repository,

Stage and commit that file locally,

Push the commit to the remote master branch.

Once the changes are pushed, a server-side hook or automation on the remote end processes your commit and reveals the password.

🧭 Step-by-Step Instructions
✅ 1. Navigate to the Cloned Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
cd /tmp/<your_cloned_repo>  # Replace with your actual path
📝 2. Create a New File
You can create any file (e.g., report.txt):

bash
Copy
Edit
echo "This is a test commit" > report.txt
📥 3. Stage the File
Use git add to stage the file for commit:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add report.txt
✅ 4. Commit the File
Now commit your staged change with a message:

bash
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "Adding a test report file"
⬆️ 5. Push to Remote master Branch
Push your changes using:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin master
Once the push is successful, the server will automatically process your commit and return the password to your terminal output.
