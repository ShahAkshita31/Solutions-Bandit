In this level, there are two files in the home directory:

passwords.old
passwords.new

The password for the next level is the only difference between the two files, and it is found in passwords.new.
-->diff passwords.new passwords.old

Explanation of the Command:
diff <file1> <file2>
→ Compares two files line by line and shows the differences.
By typing passwords.new as the first file, the output will highlight lines that are different in passwords.new compared to passwords.old.


The line starting with < comes from passwords.new.
The line starting with > comes from passwords.old.

The difference  is the password for the next level.

Take the value shown with the < symbol — that’s the password for bandit18.
