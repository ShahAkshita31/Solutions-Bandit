ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 

In this level, the password for the next level is stored next to the word millionth in a file called data.txt.

First, examine the file structure to understand how the data is presented.
You can use the head command to view the first few lines:
--> head -n 10 data.txt
head -n 10 shows the first 10 lines of the file.
This helps you understand how the hashes or data are formatted. The word is written and then hash is written right next to it so we just need to find the word millionth 

Then, search for the line containing the word millionth:
--> grep millionth data.txt
grep is a command used to search for specific text or patterns inside files or outputs.
This will return the line that contains the word millionth, along with the password that follows it.

The output from the grep command will look something like:
millionth:hashhhh
Here, the password is the part after the colon (:). Copy that value to use for the next level.
